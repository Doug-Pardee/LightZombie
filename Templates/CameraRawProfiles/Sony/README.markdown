# Raw profiles for new Sony camera models

Users:

One of the features of LightZone is that it automatically applies
a ZoneMapper-type tool called a Raw Tone Curve
to Raw files from recognized cameras.
LightZone *can* process Raw files without a Raw Tone Curve for that camera,
but the result will tend to be somewhat on the dark side.

Here are some Raw Tone Curve files for Sony cameras that weren't included
in LightZone 3.9.
Install the file(s) into your normal LightZone template folder.
On Windows,
there's a `LightZone\Templates` folder in your main documents folder.
On Linux,
there's a `Templates` directory in the LightZone installation directory.

**==>** If you need a Raw Tone Curve file for a camera model that isn't here,
please submit a request in the
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/issues).
There are a lot of camera models that need Raw Tone Curves,
but a limited number of LightZone licensees left.
Do let us know there's a need for a particular camera profile.
