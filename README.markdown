# The LightZombie Project - (obsolescent)
** **
**This project is obsolescent. LightZone is now open source.
See https://github.com/Aries85/LightZone for current activity.**
** **
The LightZombie Project was an unofficial, volunteer, open-source project
that aimed to keep the LightZone photo editor usable for as long as practical.
LightZone's creator, Light Crafts Inc., ceased operations in September 2011.
In December 2012, Fabio Ricardi released the LightZone 3.9 source under a
BSD license.

New LightZone licenses are no longer being sold,
but existing licenses continue to work.
The activation process goes through Digital River's eSellerate,
not through Light Crafts, so activation isn't a problem.
The Linux version doesn't do activation at all.

This github project is the technical side of the LightZombie Project.
Here you will find files to download,
a tech-oriented [wiki](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/wiki),
and an issue tracker.

If you've lost the install package for LightZone and need a replacement,
or if you're on a Mac and have found out that
the 3.9 version doesn't work with Java SE6 or Lion,
you'll find links to download the latest/final install packages
over on the [wiki](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/wiki).

**Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Doug-Pardee/LightZombie/wiki)
for more information.**

## Navigating github

There's a full-width button bar just below the project name.
The buttons of interest are:

* **Code** -- here you'll find files for downloading,
mixed in with some other stuff you probably don't care about.
In particular, the README files are used by github
to create descriptions like this one you're reading right now,
so there's no point in opening them because they're already displayed.
To download a file,
you'll probably need to click on the "Raw" option after you click the file.

* **Issues** -- here you can enter an issue report for any problems that
you find, and to see what issues have been reported and/or fixed.

* **Wiki** -- here is some tech information collected by the LightZombie
staff.

## Interested in contributing?

Software developers are welcome to contribute.
At the moment we could especially use a Mac developer to support that platform,
and someone familiar with EXIF to work out the kinks in metadata interpretation.
To contribute, simply fork the project,
make your changes, commit them and push them to the github repository,
then submit a Pull Request (you might need to learn about git and github first).

If you just want to contribute to the wiki, you'll need a github account.
Then send an email to Doug-Pardee requesting access.
The email address is in his github profile.

## The LightZombie necromancy crew:

* Tex Andrews - communications, coordination
* Doug Pardee - dcraw, camera raw profiles, Windows, github
* (open) - metadata (EXIF, etc.)
* (open) - Mac
* Marcelo Anelli - Linux
